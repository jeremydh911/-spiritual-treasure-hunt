Whimsy — Not Magic (policy)

Purpose
- Allow playful, imaginative elements (talking animals, memorial stones, symbolic "vibes") while preventing any pagan/occult explanation.
- Ensure all whimsical content is scripture‑rooted and properly attributed to God, natural cause, or vision/context.

Rules
- Allowed: Eden/pre‑Fall depictions, talking animals as teachers in visions or narrative, natural remedies framed as God’s created provision, symbolic reminders (stones, banners).
- Forbidden: charms, spells, divination, ritual practices presented as inherently causative, occult iconography, or any language that implies objects have independent supernatural power.

Reviewer checklist for whimsy items
- theologicalNote present and cites Scripture
- explicit attribution: God | creation | vision — NOT an object’s inherent power
- no occult wording or imagery
- per‑denom approval for sensitive cultural/religious symbols
- child copy must be age‑safe and explanatory; Mature Mode may include deeper theology

UI guidelines
- show a `Bible Context` tooltip for whimsical items
- label pre‑Fall/vision content clearly
- mature explanations are gated behind age verification/church settings

Example approved phrasing
- "This stone helps us remember God's faithfulness." (allowed)

Example disallowed phrasing
- "Use this charm to make someone well." (forbidden)

Enforcement
- Automated scans detect banned keywords/imagery, then queue items for manual theological review.
- Denominational veto possible; parental override controls respected per policy.
