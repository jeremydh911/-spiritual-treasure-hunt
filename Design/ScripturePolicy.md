Scripture & Secondary Sources — policy

Purpose
- Make explicit how the game treats Scripture vs. non‑canonical/secondary texts (apocrypha, church fathers, historical summaries, devotionals).

Policy summary (short)
- Canonical Scripture is the authoritative and final standard used by the game for theology, identity truths, doctrinal claims, and in‑game Scripture mechanics.
- Apocryphal and other non‑canonical writings are treated only as historical/contextual or devotional background where helpful; they are NEVER presented as Scripture or equal to canonical texts.
- Any secondary material included must be explicitly labeled "Secondary / Non‑canonical" and must be checked for theological alignment with canonical Scripture before being added.

Practical rules for content authors
1. Never quote apocryphal passages as if they were Scripture. Always label them clearly (e.g., "Apocryphal: [title]").
2. Before including a secondary text as background or illustration, run a theological alignment check: does the secondary text contradict core teachings of canonical Scripture? If yes — do not include.
3. In Mature Mode only: secondary texts may be shown for historical/contextual study with an explicit note explaining their non‑canonical status and how to read them critically.
4. All scriptural citations displayed to players come from canonical books only. The UI will tag any non‑canonical reference visibly as "Secondary / Non‑canonical".

Developer note
- The content vetting pipeline enforces this policy during the theological review step and marks failed items with `vetStatus: draft` until resolved.

Rationale
- This policy protects theological clarity for players and families and supports denominational sensitivity while still allowing historical and pastoral resources to be consulted by mature learners and leaders.
