Discussion Guide — Idolatry Today (Mature Mode)

Overview
- Define idolatry in practical terms and help teens recognize modern idols (status, money, social media, approval).

Core teaching
- Idols replace God in our hearts when we seek satisfaction in created things.
- Discuss practical steps to remove idols and reorient to worship.

Scenarios & questions
- "If your phone felt more important than your family, what would you change?"
- Case study: dealing with envy when social media shows 'perfect lives.'

Action items
- Create a 'Sunday audit' checklist: what consumed your attention this week?
- Replace one idol activity with a worshipful habit (prayer, service).

Parent/leader notes
- Avoid shaming; emphasize grace and practical steps to re‑prioritize.
