Discussion Guide — Kingdom Responsibility & Privileges (Mature Mode)

Overview
- Help teens understand spiritual citizenship: responsibility, stewardship, service, and leadership.

Teaching points
- Privilege in the kingdom is tied to service, not status.
- Christians are stewards of gifts, time, and influence. **Stewardship is treated as an ongoing kingdom responsibility — the game encourages daily practices and leadership pathways that reflect faithful stewardship.**

Activities
- Leadership reflection: identify one area to serve in your family/church this month.
- Role‑play: difficult leadership decisions and servant responses.

Discussion questions
- What responsibilities come with spiritual maturity?
- How does the Bible correct pride in leadership?

Church leader notes
- Offer mentoring programs, service pathways, and mentoring checklists.
