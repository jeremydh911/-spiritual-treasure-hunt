Discussion Guide — Nephilim (Mature Mode)

Overview (for parents/church leaders)
- Purpose: provide historical/contextual background and pastoral framing for Bible passages that mention "Nephilim" (Genesis 6).
- Approach: age‑appropriate explanation, avoid sensationalism, focus on God's sovereignty and human sin.

Key points to teach
- The Bible's reference to Nephilim is brief and enigmatic; Christians read such passages through Christ and redemption.
- Emphasize: God's control, human responsibility, and the Bible's primary focus on God's plan for salvation.

Scripture anchors
- Genesis 6:1–8 (context) — read in age‑appropriate sections
- Numbers 13:33 (report of giants in Canaan) — explain as report, not primary doctrine

Conversation starters (age 18+)
- "What does it mean when the Bible mentions giants?"
- "Why should we avoid making scary stories out of puzzling verses?"

Pastoral cautions
- If the subject raises fear or anxiety, redirect to passages about God’s protection (Psalm 23, Romans 8).
- For persistent concerns, recommend pastoral counseling.

Activity idea (family)
- Read Genesis 6 together and write a short paragraph on what it teaches about God and humans.
