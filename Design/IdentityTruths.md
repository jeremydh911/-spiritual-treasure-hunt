Identity Truths — design brief

Purpose
- Teach core Christian identity statements (e.g., "I am a child of God", "I am loved", "I am forgiven", "I am a citizen of heaven") as foundational, scripture‑anchored truths for players to learn and internalize.
- Deliver through short quests, memorization, daily affirmations, and narrative reinforcement (not therapeutic replacement).

Core truths (Phase‑1)
- I am a child of God — John 1:12; adoption in Christ
- I am forgiven — 1 John 1:9; Romans 5:8
- I am loved — Romans 8:38-39; 1 John 4:9-10
- I am a citizen of heaven — Philippians 3:20
- I am accepted (I belong to God's family) — Romans 15:7; Ephesians 2:19

Extended / Phase‑2 truths (examples)
- I am chosen — 1 Peter 2:9
- I am never alone — Hebrews 13:5; Matthew 28:20
- I am redeemed — Galatians 3:13; Colossians 1:14
- I am a friend of God — John 15:15
- I am God's ambassador — 2 Corinthians 5:20
- I am free in Christ — Galatians 5:1
- I am royalty — 1 Peter 2:9
- I am made new — 2 Corinthians 5:17
- I am safe — Psalm 91:1
- I am renewed — Ephesians 4:23
- I am blessed — Ephesians 1:3
- I have a purpose — Ephesians 2:10

Scripture provenance & secondary sources
- Canonical Scripture is the authoritative standard in the game. Secondary writings (apocrypha, devotionals, church fathers) are treated only as background; they are clearly labeled `Secondary / Non‑canonical` and must be verified against canonical Scripture (see Design/ScripturePolicy.md).

Mechanics
- TruthToken: collectible unlock (persistent) awarded by short quests or memorization challenges.
- Daily Affirmation: short daily prompt that encourages the player to repeat/memorize a truth (reward: spiritualStrength or small cosmetic).
- Truths Hall: UI listing owned truths with ScriptureRefs and a short devotional application.

Pedagogy
- Use repetition + short Scripture memorization + practical application tasks (service, testimony) to reinforce identity.
- Pair each truth with a small, age‑appropriate scenario showing how that truth changes behavior.

Mature Mode
- Provide deeper theological reflection for older players/parents (e.g., adoption language, citizenship privileges, pastoral questions about identity crises).

Vetting & safety
- All identity statements must include ScriptureRefs and a short theologicalNote. Avoid therapeutic or diagnostic language; refer persistent issues to pastoral care.

Acceptance criteria
- Player can collect at least 5 TruthTokens in Phase‑1.  
- Affirmation UI shows daily truth and records whether player completed the daily affirmation (streaks optional).  
- Playtests: ≥80% of kids correctly repeat a selected truth after completing the memory quest.
