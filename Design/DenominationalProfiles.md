Denominational Profiles — overview

Purpose
- Allow per‑denomination profiles that influence translation preference, doctrinal emphasis, allowed cosmetics, and sensitive content rules.

Profile fields (examples)
- denomId, name, preferredTranslations[], blockedTopics[], allowedCosmeticTags[], liturgicalOptions[]

Default shipped profiles (initial)
- non-denominational / evangelical (default)
- mainline protestant
- catholic (optional later)

How profiles are used
- Content items (quests, cosmetics) include denomTags and denomApprovals.
- Church Dashboard maps a church to a denomProfile; church admins can further customize.

Governance
- Studio curates default denominational profiles; partner churches may request custom profiles for their members.
- All final content approvals require theological sign‑off when sensitivity is medium/high.
