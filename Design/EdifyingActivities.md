Edifying Activities — system design

Purpose
- Provide additional, biblically based ways for characters to grow beyond worship, prayer, and Scripture reading.
- Activities are persistent, non‑pay‑to‑win upgrades that unlock narrative options, titles, and opportunities for service.

Example activities
- Service (Galatians 5:13) — help NPCs, community tasks, hospitality.
- Mentoring / Discipleship (2 Timothy 2:2) — teach or guide younger players/NPCs.
- Sabbath / Rest Practices (Exodus 20; Mark 2) — rhythm of rest that restores spiritual strength.
- Artistic Expression (Psalm 150) — music, art, and performance as worship and community building.
- Stewardship Practice (Genesis 2; 1 Peter 4) — manage resources and give wisely.
- Accountability / Confession (James 5:16) — mature practice — gated to Mature Mode.

Mechanics
- Activities are earned by quests, service events, or church‑led projects.
- OwnedActivities[] is saved on PlayerProfile; activities unlock narrative options and may open activity‑specific quests.
- Activities are not gameplay power‑ups; they provide titles, dialog, and kingdom opportunities.

Angelic intersection
- Angels may suggest activity opportunities (e.g., guide to a neighbor in need) and for adults provide deeper counsel or support for accountability (Mature Mode only).

Vetting
- Each activity must include scriptureRefs and theological notes (Design/QuestSpec requirement).
- Per‑denom approval required for activities touching sacramental or confession practices.
