# Art Pass Briefs

This file contains notes for placeholder art assets used in the prototype. Replace with final art as available.

- **Kingdom UI**: simple colored panels and icon placeholders.
- **Sin Bridge**: two cube models (left/right) with different colors.
- **Card assets**: flat textures with scripture IDs (currently numeric placeholders).
- **Quest Hub stones**: spheres/boxes with labels; add polished models later.

Each asset is currently represented by a blank `.png` file in this folder; artists can overwrite with real art.
