# NOTE: This is a lightweight placeholder scene file for the prototype. Open the Unity Editor and create a Scene
# with a Canvas, add GridLayoutGroup, attach a Card prefab (Button + Text), then add the MemoryMatchMiniGame script and
# assign 'cardPrefab', 'gridParent' and 'questId' (e.g., "ECHO-001" or a virtue quest). This file is a placeholder only.
